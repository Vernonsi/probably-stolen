From the momet I understood the weakness of my flesh!
It disgusted me!
I craved the strength and cerntanty of steel!
I aspired the purity of the Blessed Machine!
Your kind cling to your flesh!
as if it will not decay and fail you!
One day the crued biomass, that you call your temle will wither!
and you will beg my kind to save you!
But I am already saved!
For the machine is immortal!
Even in death I serve the Omnissiah!
